# AutoRABIT  

[AutoRABIT](https://www.autorabit.com/) feature migration connector is an unique, one-of-a-kind structure. This will enable our users to promote their data scripts using version control. This would allow salesforce admins/release managers to migrate data and metadata 10x faster. 
We will provide you with series of data in json format and associated filters with their relationships.

## Getting Started

To understand this solution better, you can refer to the documentation [AutoRABIT/docs](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/ncino-an-overview).

To get set up and running quickly:

 - Work through the [Tutorial](http://course-catalog.teachery.co/lessons/devops-academy)
 - To set up the feature templates [Tutorial](https://academy.autorabit.com/?sfwd-courses=autorabit-ncino-integration-course)

This repository consists of an custom built structure, these folders will created for each feature template with an intention of keeping all the associated data in the feature name folder.

    ├── data                     
    ├── filters                    
    └── objectrelationships

Once you are familiar with the tutorial, you’re ready to move on.
